Resources
=========

Resources shared with Allen for the project.

### Notation used to keep track of the state of resources ###
* `+` - Denotes optional resources that have information that is good to know but is not critical for acheiving the goals of this project. This will be the default unless otherwise specified.
* `*` - Denotes resources that contain information that could be critical to acheiving the goals of this project.
* `@book`, `@video` .. - Denotes the type of resource.
* Allen - you can similarly have symbols to denote 2 states: i. that you are in the process of going through a resource, ii. you have completed viewing a resource.

Programming
-------------
* [Code.org course 3](http://studio.code.org/s/course3)

  > Course 3 is designed for students who have taken Course 2. Students will delve deeper into programming topics introduced in previous courses to flexible solutions to more complex problems. By the end of this course, students create interactive stories and games they can share with anyone. Recommended for grades 4-5.

* [Curriculum for Middle School Math | Code.org](http://code.org/curriculum/msm)
  > introductory curriculum which teaches algebraic and geometric concepts through computer programming. The nine units focus on concepts like order of operations, the Cartesian plane, function composition and definition, and solving word problems - all within the context of video game design. .. At the end of the nine units, students will have a completed workbook filled with word problems, notes, and math challenges, as well as a video game of their own design to share with friends and family.

Python programming
---------------
Resources for learning the language itself. Not related to game programming.

* [Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python, 2nd Edition](http://inventwithpython.com/chapters/) `*` `@book`
 - A very highly rated book made available for free by the Author that teaches programming using Python. Allen, we can use this as the main source for learning Python programming.

* [Python | Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python) `*` `@interactive`
  - A interactive course that teaches Python. Could be done along with or after the 'Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python' book.
 
* [Introduction to Programming with Python](https://opentechschool.github.io/python-beginners/en/index.html) `+` `@tutorial` 
 - A simple tutorial that introduces Python using turtle library.

Game programming
---------------

### Game programming using Python ###
* [Making Games with Python & Pygame](http://inventwithpython.com/pygame/index.html) `*` `@book`
  - If we decide to use PyGame, we can then use this as our main text for learning PyGame.

* [Program Arcade Games With Python And Pygame](http://programarcadegames.com/index.php?lang=en) `*` `@book`
  - Anoteher highly rated book that is available for free that teaches game programming using Python and Pygame.
  
* [Game Programming L Line](http://aharrisbooks.net/pythonGame/) `+` `@book`
  - Code and course presentations from the highly rated (non-free) PyGame book [Game Programming: The L Line, The Express Line to Learning](http://www.amazon.com/Game-Programming-Line-Express-Learning/dp/0470068221/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1420444055&sr=8-1&keywords=Game+Programming+Express+Line). But there seems to be sufficient information in the presentations and code to be usable without the book.
  
* [pyvideo.org - Introduction to game programming](http://pyvideo.org/video/2620/introduction-to-game-programming) `+` `@video`
 - video from the last PyCon conference. It introduces Game programming in Python using a library called PyGame. I realize we haven't started on Python programming yet - but you should still be able to watch the video and able to learn many important information. We can revisit this again as we are learning Python.

* Sample projects
  * Psuedo FPS game with Pygame

After this project
---------------------
Resources covering advanced topics that might be a good path to pursue after this project.

### Programming ###

* [Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python, Revised and Expanded Edition | Vancouver Public Library | BiblioCommons](http://vpl.bibliocommons.com/item/show/3636111038_introduction_to_computation_and_programming_using_python,_revised_and_expanded_edition) `+` `@book`

 > This book introduces students with little or no prior programming experience to the art of computational problem solving using Python and various Python libraries, including PyLab. It provides students with skills that will enable them to make productive use of computational techniques, including some of the tools and techniques of "data science" for using computation to model and interpret data. The book is based on an MIT course (which became the most popular course offered through MIT's OpenCourseWare) and was developed for use not only in a conventional classroom but in a massive open online course (or MOOC) offered by the pioneering MIT-Harvard collaboration edX. Students are introduced to Python and the basics of programming in the context of such computational concepts and techniques as exhaustive enumeration, bisection search, and efficient approximation algorithms. The book does not require knowledge of mathematics beyond high school algebra, but does assume that readers are comfortable with rigorous thinking and not intimidated by mathematical concepts.

### Game development ###

* [Practical Game Development With Unity and Blender | Vancouver Public Library | BiblioCommons](http://vpl.bibliocommons.com/item/show/4059751038_practical_game_development_with_unity_and_blender) `+` `@book`

* [Creating Games With Unity and Maya | Vancouver Public Library | BiblioCommons](http://vpl.bibliocommons.com/item/show/3037113038_creating_games_with_unity_and_maya) `+` `@book`


### Linux, Opensource and Git ###

* [The Cathedral and the Bazaar](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/) `+` `@book`

  > The Cathedral and the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary (abbreviated CatB) is an essay, and later a book, by Eric S. Raymond on software engineering methods, based on his observations of the Linux kernel development process and his experiences managing an open source project, fetchmail.
